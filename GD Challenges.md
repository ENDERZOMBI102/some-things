those challenges will "help" you spice up the game :P

1. Upside down screen, flip the entire screen (display settings>orientation)
2. See the start, you have to cover the entire screen but not the first right part of (from end of the progress bar to the end of the pause button)
3. Don't look at me, play normally, but you have to look at the screen indirectly ( look at the tv but still play on the monitor)
4. Look at chat, basically, you have to always look at the chat where it is
5. Mirror's edge, look the screen in a mirror
6. Musical change, listen to another level's music
7. Good memory!, you can only see the character
8. Lights out, play in the dark, with most darker possible
9. Make it double, take a challenge and double it somehow
10. Combo, make a combo of two challenges
11. Full combo, same as above, but with all of them
